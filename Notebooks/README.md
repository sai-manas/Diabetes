# Python note books of Classification models used on Diabetes dataset
1. I applied **Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machines classifiers** on the diabetes dataset to predict whether patients are diabetic or not.
2. Four notebooks have been uploaded, each dedicated to a different model.
3. Model performance was evaluated using various metrics, and the model with the highest score was deployed in a web application using the `pickle` library.
4. After evaluating various models using metrics such as **accuracy, classification report, cross-validation score, and Grid Search CV best score**, I have chosen to deploy my application using the **Logistic Regression** pickle file. This model demonstrated superior performance with an accuracy of **80%** compared to other models.
